    <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
    
    <h1 id="html"></h1>
<p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating websites and CSS is the language that describes the style of an HTML document.

    We will combine HTML and CSS to create a basic HTML Book.</p>
<p>The code explained above are HTML tags.

    HTML tags are used to define the content of an HTML dokument.
    
    The tags start with a  (less-than sign) and end witn a  (greater-than sign).</p>

<p>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <h1 id="hello"></h1>
<p>Hello World" redirects here. For other uses, see Hello World (disambiguation).</p>

<p>A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code.[1][2] It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</p>

    <h1>Application</h1>
    <h1 id="app"></h1>

<p>An application program is a computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one relating to the operation of the computer itself,</p>
<p>typically to be used by end-users. Word processors, media players, and accounting software are examples. The collective noun refers to all applications collectively.</p>

    <h1>audience</h1>
    <h1 id="audience"></h1>

<p>An audience is a group of people who participate in a show or encounter a work of art, literature (in which they are called "readers"), theatre, music (in which they are called "listeners"), video games (in which they are called "players"), or academics in any medium. Audience members participate in different ways in different kinds of art; some events invite overt audience participation and others allowing only modest clapping and criticism and reception.</p>
<p>Media audience studies have become a recognized part of the curriculum. Audience theory offers scholarly insight into audiences in general. These insights shape our knowledge of just how audiences affect and are affected by different forms of art. The biggest art form is the mass media. Films, video games, radio shows, software (and hardware), and other formats are affected by the audience and its reviews and recommendations.</p>
<p>In the age of easy internet participation and citizen journalism, professional creators share space, and sometimes attention with the public. American journalist Jeff Jarvis said, "Give the people control of media, they will use it. The corollary: Don't give the people control of media, and you will lose. Whenever citizens can exercise control, they will."[1] Tom Curley, President of the Associated Press, similarly said, "The users are deciding what the point of their engagement will be â€” what application, what device, what time, what place."</p>
